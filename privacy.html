    notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you

    We may allow third parties to serve advertisements in connection with our
    Services, to provide analytics services and provide you with other
    services, such as rewards programs and tournaments. These third parties may
    use cookies, web beacons, your account information (that you set up with
    these third parties) and other technologies to collect information about

    addresses, identifiers associated with your mobile device or applications
    on the device, the browsers you use to visit our Services, pages viewed,
    time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. These third

    This information may be used by Raven Interactive, and these other
    companies and their customers and clients, to analyze and track data,
    determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and
    content targeted to your interests, and better understand your usage. Some

    to opt out the collection of and/or sharing of this information; links to
    the opt-out mechanisms for the third parties that offer such a choice can

    apply to, and we are not responsible for, third-party cookies, web beacons,
    or other tracking technologies.

    Raven Interactive takes reasonable measures to help protect information
    about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
    alteration and destruction.
